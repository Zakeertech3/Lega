        "content": "section 242 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), with \u201chaving been in possession of\ncounterfeit coin, having known at the time when he became possessed thereof that such coin was counterfeit,\u201d the word\n\u201cfraudulently\u201d being omitted in the charge. Unless it appears that A was in fact misled by this omission, the error shall not\nbe regarded as material.\n(b) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge or is set out\nincorrectly. A defends himself, calls witnesses and gives his own account of the transaction. The Court may infer from this\nthat the omission to set out the manner of the cheating is not material.\n(c) A is charged with cheating B, and the manner in which he cheated B is not set out in the charge. There were many\n108\ntransactions between A and B, and A had no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred, and offered no\ndefence. The Court may infer from such facts that the omission to set out the manner of the cheating was, in the case, a\nmaterial error.\n(d) A is charged with the murder of Khoda Baksh on the 21st January, 1882. In fact, the murdered person's name was\nHaidar Baksh, and the date of the murder was the 20th January, 1882. A was never charged with any murder but one, and\nhad heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which referred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer\nfrom these facts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.\n(e) A was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 1882, and Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him\nfor that murder) on the 21st January, 1882. When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the murder of\nKhoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from\nthis that A was misled, and that the error was material.\n216. Court may alter charge.\u2014(1) Any Court may alter or add to any charge at any time before\njudgment is pronounced.\n(2) Every such alteration or addition shall be read and explained to the accused.\n(3) If the alteration or addition to a charge is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is not\nlikely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused in his defence or the prosecutor in the conduct\nof the case, the Court may, in its discretion, after such alteration or addition has been made, proceed with\nthe trial as if the altered or added charge had been the original charge.\n(4) If the alteration or addition is such that proceeding immediately with the trial is likely, in the\nopinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor as aforesaid, the Court may either direct a\nnew trial or adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary.\n(5) If the offence stated in the altered or added charge is one for the prosecution of which previous\nsanction is necessary, the case shall not be proceeded with until such sanction is obtained, unless sanction\nhas been already obtained for a prosecution on the same facts as those on which the altered or added\ncharge is founded.\n217. Recall of witnesses when charge altered.\u2014Whenever a charge is altered or added to by the\nCourt after the commencement of the trial, the prosecutor and the accused shall be allowed\u2014\n(a) to recall or re-summon, and examine with reference to such alteration or addition, any witness\nwho may have been examined, unless the Court, for reasons to be recorded in writing, considers that\nthe prosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, desires to recall or re-examine such witness for the\npurpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice;\n(b) also to call any further witness whom the Court may think to be material.\nB.\u2014Joinder of charges\n218. Separate charges for distinct offences.\u2014(1) For every distinct offence of which any person is\naccused there shall be a separate charge, and every such charge shall be tried separately:\nProvided that where the accused person, by an application in writing, so desires and the Magistrate is\nof opinion that such person is not likely to be prejudiced thereby, the Magistrate may try together all or\nany number of the charges framed against such person.\n(2) Nothing in sub-section (1) shall affect the operation of the provisions of sections 219, 220, 221\nand 223.\n109\nIllustration\nA is accused of a theft on one occasion, and of causing grievous hurt on another occasion. A must be separately charged and\nseparately tried for the theft and causing grievous hurt.\n219.
