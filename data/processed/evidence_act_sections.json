In order to show A\u2019s intent the fact of A\u2019s having\npreviously shot at B may be proved.\n(j) A is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening letters previously sent by A to B may be\nproved, as showing the intention of the letters.\n(k) The question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife.\nExpressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or after the alleged cruelty are relevant facts.\n(l) The question is whether A\u2019s death was caused by poison.\nStatements made by A during his illness as to his symptoms are relevant facts.\n(m) The question is, what was the state of A\u2019s health at the time when an assurance on his life was effected.\nStatements made by A as to the state of his health at or near the time in question are relevant facts.\n(n) A sues B for negligence in providing him with a carriage for hire not reasonably fit for use, whereby A was\ninjured.\nThe fact that B\u2019s attention was drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular carriage is relevant.\nThe fact that B was habitually negligent about the carriages which he let to hire is irrelevant.\n(o) A is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead.\nThe fact that A on other occasions shot at B is relevant as showing his intention to shoot B.\n17\nThe fact that A was in the habit of shooting at people with intent to murder them is irrelevant.\n(p) A is tried for a crime.\nThe fact that he said something indicating an intention to commit that particular crime is relevant.\nThe fact that he said something indicating a general disposition to commit crimes of that class is\nirrelevant.\n15.

Burden of proof as to particular fact. \u2013\u2013The burden of proof as to any particular fact lies on\nthat person who wishes the Court to believe in its existence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof\nof that fact shall lie on any particular person.\nIllustrations\n1[(a)] A prosecutes B for theft, and wishes the Court to believe that B admitted the theft to C.

When they may be asked. \u2013\u2013 Leading questions may be asked in cross-examination.\n144. Evidence as to matters in writing. \u2013\u2013 Any witness may be asked, whilst under examination,\nwhether any contract, grant or other disposition of property, as to which he is giving evidence, was not\ncontained in a document, and if he says that it was, or if he is about to make any statement as to the\ncontents of any document, which, in the opinion of the Court, ought to be produced, the adverse party\nmay object to such evidence being given until such document is produced, or until facts have been proved\nwhich entitle the party who called the witness to give secondary evidence of it.\nExplanation. \u2013\u2013 A witness may give oral evidence of statements made by other persons about the\ncontents of documents if such statements are in themselves relevant facts.\nIllustration\nThe question is, whether A assaulted B.\nC deposes that he heard A say to D\u2013\u2013 \u201cB wrote a letter accusing me of theft, and I will be revenged\non him.\u201d This statement is relevant, as showing A\u2019s motive for the assault, and evidence may be given of\nit, though no other evidence is given about the letter.\n1145. Cross-examination as to previous statements in writing. \u2013\u2013 A witness may be cross-\nexamined as to previous statements made by him in writing or reduced into writing, and relevant to\nmatters in question, without such writing being shown to him, or being proved; but, if it is intended to\ncontradict him by the writing, his attention must, before the writing can be proved, be called to those parts\nof it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him.\n146. Questions lawful in cross-examination. \u2013\u2013 When a witness is cross-examined, he may, in\naddition to the questions hereinbefore referred to, be asked any questions which tend\u2013\u2013\n(1) to test his veracity,\n(2) to discover who he is and what is his position in life, or\n(3) to shake his credit, by injuring his character, although the answer to such questions might tend\ndirectly or indirectly to criminate him, or might expose or tend directly or indirectly to expose him to\na penalty or forfeiture:\n2[Provided that in a prosecution for an offence under"
